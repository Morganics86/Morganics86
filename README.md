- 👋 Hey Everyone, I’m @Morganics86
- 👀 I’m interested in Building Websites, front and back end
- 🌱 I’m learning HTML after attempting python. Given what Im trying to build, I thought it made more sense to begin with HTML.
- 💞️ Im new and don't know much about code languages or repositories, so I may not be very useful by way of collaberation.
Any advice, well wishes, constructive critiques are welcome. genuinely mean spirited comments can go kick rocks.
- 📫 contact me at chancyclancy@gmail.com
